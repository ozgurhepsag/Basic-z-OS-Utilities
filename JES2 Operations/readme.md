I have a monoplex that has no CICS, DB2, IMS, MQ or any ISV products. I decided to begin my practice to add one more spool volume for JES2 and then replace my check point data sets both.

## Adding SPOOL Volume

#### Display Current Configuration

Before this practise, I just have one model-9 volume for JES2 spool dataset. Volume serial mask of the spool is 'SPL0' in my system (as you can see below VOLUME=SPL0) and my volume serial is SPL001.

    $D SPL,LONG

You can see below my spool definition. Track Group is simply an allocation unit for spool (You can see the definitions of the SPOOLDEF parameters from [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=definition-parameter-description-spooldef)). The more TG space, the more space for the spool.

    $D SPOOLDEF

#### Add New Volume

I added model-27 volume with VOL=SER=SPL002, then SPL002 volume was made online. The spool volumes must not be SMS-managed. You can see below my JCL to initialize the volume. 

    //INITVOL  JOB  (),'OZGUR',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H,REGION=0M,               
    //   NOTIFY=&SYSUID,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)                                     
    //INITD    EXEC PGM=ICKDSF,PARM='NOREPLYLU,FORCE'                      
    //SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*                                               
    //SYSIN    DD   *                                                      
     INIT UNIT(1021) VTOC(0,1,14) NVFY PRG VOLID(SPL002)

#### Check TGSPACE value

In SPOOLDEF, it is given that TGSPACE could be maximum 114016 and 50075 of TGSPACE is being active now. Since I wanted to use all of my new spool volume (model 27 â‰ˆ 200000 TGS), I needed to change my maximum TGSPACE value sufficiently. Don't forget to update JES2 PARMLIB member!

    $T SPOOLDEF,TGSPACE

Maximum TGSPACE value should be specified as a multiple of 16288, otherwise JES2 will automatically increase your specification to the next highest multiple of 16288.

#### Start New Spool Volume

When you start new volume with command below, spool data set will be allocated (with maximum space) automatically and reserved.

    $S SPL(SPL002),FORMAT,RESERVED=YES,SPACE=(MAX)

I could take some time while spool data set is being formatted.

Then, my new spool data set formatted succesfully.

However, new volume could not be used, because it is RESERVED. It should be RESERVED=NO.

You can see that the volume is RESERVED from SP panel of SDSF (ACTIVE-R).

I made RESERVED=NO and you can see below the Spool Utilization is decreased from 7.7064 to 1.8043.

    $T SPOOL(SPL002),RESERVED=NO

#### Using New Spool Volume

Now, new TSU, STC jobs, and batch jobs could be allocated on our new spool volume. I submitted dummy jobs and I saw that those allocated on my new spool volume (SPL002).

## Replace Checkpoint Data Sets

will be added.
